The Alzheimer Europe Organisation estimates that by the 2050 the amount of people living with dementia will have doubled in Europe, meaning an increase from 9'780'678 to 18'846'286 people \autocite{Europe}. Other estimations suggest that dementia is present in 50 million people worldwide and is predicted to triple by the year 2050 \autocite{AZ}. \gls{AD} is the most prevalent form of dementia and may account for 60-80\% of all dementia cases \autocite{8267050}. In elder population, \gls{AD} has a prevalence of 10\% and is considered the most common neurodegenerative disease \autocite{nanniComparisonTransferLearning2020}.

Diagnostic criteria for \gls{AD} have changed multiple times, moving past an exclusively clinical approach of diagnosing \gls{AD}, towards incorporating biological aspects \autocite{SCHELTENS2021}. The \gls{nia-aa} putting forward the AT(N) research framework -- labeled after the suggested biological markers for \gls{AD}: $\beta$-amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration \autocite{jackNIAAAResearchFramework2018} -- reflects the trend of separating clinical symptoms from disease pathology and having purely biological criteria for \gls{AD} \autocite{SCHELTENS2021, ahmedHistoryPerspectiveHow2021}. Still, diagnosis is primarily done clinically \autocite{ahmedHistoryPerspectiveHow2021} and, as \textcite{islamBrainMRIAnalysis2018} describe, requires physical and neurological examinations, a detailed history of the patient as well as tests, like \gls{mmse} \autocite{FOLSTEIN1975189}. A definite diagnosis can only be made post-mortem \autocite{nanniComparisonTransferLearning2020}.

In vivo diagnosis accuracy can be affected by the heterogeneity of the clinical symptoms in \gls{AD}  \autocite{ahmedHistoryPerspectiveHow2021, frisoni2011} but increases with the development of the disease \autocite{islamBrainMRIAnalysis2018}. Still, it is notable that \enquote{\textit{10\%} to \textit{30\%} of individuals clinically diagnosed as \gls{AD} dementia by experts do not display \gls{AD} neuropathologic changes at autopsy} \autocite[Nelson, 2011, as cited in][p. 538]{jackNIAAAResearchFramework2018}. Although, as \textcite{jackNIAAAResearchFramework2018} state, the AT(N) framework isn't ready for general clinical usage, it addresses these mentioned challenges by defining \gls{AD} biologically. This definition includes biomarkers from three categories that form the acronym AT(N): $\beta$-amyloid accumulation, pathologic tau and neurodegeneration \autocite{jackNIAAAResearchFramework2018}. Compared to \gls{pet}, that measures $\beta$-amyloid accumulation or tau, \gls{mri} is less invasive and can be used to measure neurodegeneration \autocite{wangDenseCNNDenselyConnected2021}. Additionally, \gls{mri} is always recommended following the clinical evaluation \autocite{SCHELTENS2021} and is often used as a tool for finding relevant biomarkers \autocite{liuMultimodelDeepConvolutional2020a}. 

Methods such as mass-univariate analyses which are large amount of univariate tests (e.g. t-tests) \autocite{groppeMassUnivariateAnalysis2011} have been used in combination with neuroimaging studies and led to significant insight into psychiatric and neurological disorders \autocite{vieiraUsingDeepLearning2017}. In the case of \gls{mri} analysis of \gls{AD}, hippocampus and other medial temporal lobe structures are of interest \autocite{islamBrainMRIAnalysis2018,SCHELTENS2021}. 
\textcite{vieiraUsingDeepLearning2017} describe \gls{ML} methods as alternative analysis techniques which, in comparison, are multivariate meaning that they take the inter-correlation between voxels into consideration \autocite{vieiraUsingDeepLearning2017}. Furthermore, \gls{ML} methods could allow for individual  treatment decisions to be made \autocite{naikDenouementsMachineLearning2020}, since these methods make statistical inference at an individual level \autocite{vieiraUsingDeepLearning2017}. These properties have created a growing interest in \gls{ML} methods for analysing neuroimaging data \autocite{vieiraUsingDeepLearning2017}. Furthermore, \gls{ML} methods could automate the process of analysing \gls{mri} images and consequently safe resources \autocite{islamBrainMRIAnalysis2018}. Additionally, \gls{ML} methods have the ability of finding disease-related patterns without prior knowledge about underlying mechanisms \autocite{nanniComparisonTransferLearning2020}. 

Considering these described aspects, \gls{ML} methods seem suitable for analysing MRI scans related to \gls{AD}. Many studies using \gls{ML} to classify \gls{AD} have been reviewed in the past \autocite[see][]{ebrahimighahnaviehDeepLearningDetect2020,joDeepLearningAlzheimer2019, tanveerMachineLearningTechniques2020, wenConvolutionalNeuralNetworks2020, noorApplicationDeepLearning2020}. Aiming to provide an updated view on the state of research, this review compares novel studies using \gls{ML} methods for classifying Alzheimer's Disease.
